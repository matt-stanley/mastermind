The code will be 4 digits, 1 - 6. This represents the six colors in the original game.

Ask the player if they would like to be code maker or breaker.

If the player selects "code maker", prompt to choose difficulty.

If breaker, the computer will randomly generate a code.
  The player will make a guess and get feedback, the same as from a human opponent.
  The player wins if they guess within 10 guesses.

If maker, prompt the player to choose CPU difficulty.
  - Weak will make random guesses.
  - Standard will use the 1977 Knuth method without minmax.
  - Mastermind will use the full Knuth algorithm.

The computer will only have 6 guesses.
